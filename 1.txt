// prempt a new arrival q2, check is next dpart event has lower priority(no need to check it self since fcfs), push to the queue, next loop
// next arrival is q1, check priority, and found next is lower, so push it to the q1, and update the last arrival q2's service time(q2 service time - q2's arrival - q1's arrivale)
// push q2 back to q2, update dpart event time(clock + q1 service)

// for depart, just go though all queues, and pick one by order for generating  dpart
